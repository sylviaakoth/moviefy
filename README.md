## How it works

When you navigate to the movie page, you will see a list of movies. Each movie has a like count and after 5 likes, your selected movie will be added to your favourites playlist. When you. (you will have to redirect to another page like from movies to home when you like a movie in order for the like count to increase). 

When you visit the search page, you will be able to navigate movies much easier using key words, as simple as three letters and your movie will pop up. 

Enjoy moviefy-movies and happy watching!
